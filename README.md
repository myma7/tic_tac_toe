# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the cells in a 3x3 grid with either a circle or a cross. The game announces a winner when a player aligns three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, and offers a reset button to play again.

## Features
### Interactive Game Board
- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players can click on cells to place their marks (circle or cross).
- Players take turns, and the current player's turn is displayed.

### Winning and Draw Conditions
- The game checks for winning conditions (three circles or crosses in a row, column, or diagonal).
- The game announces the winner or a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.

### Game Restart
- A "rerun" button appears when the game ends, allowing players to reset the board and start a new game.

### Visual and Audio Effects
- Confetti animation is displayed when a player wins.
- Simple and clean UI with visual feedback for players.
